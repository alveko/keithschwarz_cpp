 *
 * An implementation of a sorted dictionary backed by an AVL tree.  AVL trees
 * are a type of self-balancing binary tree and were the first such structure
 * to be described that guaranteed that the tree height was no greater than
 * O(lg n).
 *
 * The idea behind the AVL tree is to ensure that for every node in the tree,
 * the height of the node's left and right subtrees differ by at most one.  To
 * see that this ensures that the tree remains balanced, we can show that the
 * minimum number of nodes n required to create a tree of height h is governed
 * by the relationship n = O(lg h).  Once we have this, we know that any AVL
 * tree containing n nodes must have height no greater than O(lg n), and all
 * the standard BST operations on such a tree will complete in time O(lg n).
 * We can show this inductively.  Let N(h) be the minimum number of nodes that
 * could be present in a tree of height h.  Clearly, N(0) = 0, since the empty
 * tree can't have any nodes in it.  We also have that N(1) = 1, since a tree
 * of height one must have at least one node.  Now, let's suppose that we are
 * considering a tree of height h + 2.  This means that the root of the tree
 * must have some subtree that has height h + 1.  Because we enforce the
 * invariant that the heights of the subtrees of each node differ by at most
 * one, this means that the minimum height of the other subtree of the root is
 * h.  This gives us that the minimum number of nodes in the tree is
 * N(h + 2) = N(h) + N(h + 1) + 1, with the +1 coming from the root element.
 * We claim that N(h) = F(h + 2) - 1, where F(h) is the hth Fibonacci 
 * number.  This proof is by induction:
 *
 *   Base cases: N(0) = 0 = 1 - 1 = F(2) - 1
 *               N(1) = 1 = 2 - 1 = F(3) - 1
 *   Inductive step: N(h + 2)  = N(h) + N(h + 1) + 1
 *                             = F(h + 2) - 1 + F(h + 3) - 1 + 1
 *                             = F(h + 2) + F(h + 3) - 1
 *                             = F(h + 4) - 1
 *                             = F((h + 2) + 2) - 1
 *
 * It's well-known that F(h) = (1 / sqrt(5)) (P^h - p^h), where
 *
 *                             P = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 ~= 1.6
 *                             p = (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2 ~= 0.6
 *
 * For h > 1, F(h) >= (P^h / sqrt(5)) - 1, and so we have that
 *
 *                       N(h)      >= P^h / sqrt(5) - 1
 *                       N(h) + 1  >= P^h / sqrt(5)
 *              sqrt(5) (N(h) + 1) >= P^h
 *        lg_P(sqrt(5) (N(h) + 1)) >= h
 *
 * And so we have that h = O(lg N(h)); that is, the height of the tree is
 * O(lg n) as required.
 *
 * Given that a tree with this structure will have O(lg n) height, the
 * question now is how we can maintain this property in the tree as we begin
 * adding and removing nodes.  To do this, we'll have each node keep track of
 * its height in the tree.  Whenever we insert a node, we can propagate the
 * new height information from the newly-inserted node up to the root.  If in
 * the course of doing so we detect that a node has two subtrees whose heights
 * differ by more than 1, we can use a series of tree rotations to fix up the
 * balancing.  In particular, there are two cases to consider, plus two
 * symmetric cases:
 *
 * Case 1: We have two nodes in this configuration:
 *
 *                                  a (+2)
 *                                 / \
 *                     (+0 or +1) b   Z
 *                               / \
 *                              X   Y
 *
 *                           
 *
 * Here, the values in parentheses are the "balance term" for each node, which
 * is defined as the difference between the height of its left and right
 * subtrees.  If we are in this case, then suppose that subtree Z has height
 * h.  Since a has a balance factor of +2, this means that the height of b
 * must be h + 2, so at least one of X or Y has height h + 1, and since the
 * balance term of b is not -1, either X and Y both have height h + 1, or X
 * has height h + 1 and Y has height h.  To fix up the balance terms here, we
 * rotate along the edge from a to b to give this setup:
 *
 *                               b (+0 or -1)
 *                              / \
 *                             X   a  (+0 or +1)
 *                                / \
 *                               Y   Z
 *
 * The values of these balance terms can be seen quite easily.  We know that 
 * Z has height h, and Y either has height h + 1 or h.  This means that node
 * a is either at height h + 1 or h + 2, and its balance term is either +0 or
 * +1.  Tree X has height h + 1 as well, and so the balance term of b is
 * either +0 or -1.  Notice that when we started the root of this tree was at
 * height h + 3, and after this operation the height is still h + 3, and so
 * none of the node heights above this tree are affected.
 *
 * Case 2: We have three nodes in this configuration:
 *
 *                                  a (+2)
 *                                 / \
 *                           (-1) b   Z
 *                               / \
 *                              W   c (?)
 *                                 / \
 *                                X   Y
 *
 * Because the balance terms are the way they are, we know that if tree Z has
 * height h, tree b has height h + 2.  Moreover, since the balance term on the
 * node is -1, we know that tree W has height h and the tree rooted at c has
 * height h + 1.  Consequently, at least one of X and Y have height h, and at
 * most one of them has height h - 1.   In this case, we do two rotations.  
 * First, we rotate c and b to get
 *
 *                               (+2) a
 *                                   / \
 *                       (+1 or +2) c   Z
 *                                 / \
 *                     (+0 or +1) b   Y
 *                               / \
 *                              W   X
 *
 * The balance terms here are as follows.  Since W has height h and X has
 * height either h or h - 1, the balance term on b is either 0 or 1, and the
 * height of the tree rooted at b is h + 1.  Y has height either h or h - 1,
 * and so the balance term on c is either +1 or +2, and it has height h + 2.
 * Finally, the height of Z is defined as h, and so a has balance term +2.  To
 * fix up all of these imbalances, we do one more rotation to pull c above a:
 *
 *                             (+0) c
 *                                /   \
 *                    (+0 or +1) b     a (+0 or -1)
 *                              / \   / \
 *                             W   X Y   Z
 *
 * The term on b is unchanged from the previous step and it is still at height
 * h + 1.  Since Z has height h and Y has height either h - 1 or h, a has
 * balance either +0 or -1, and is at height h + 1.  This means that node c
 * is at height h + 2 and has balance term 0.  However, notice that the height
 * of the root of this tree is now h + 2 instead of h + 3, meaning that the
 * balance terms of nodes above this one may need to be updated in response.
 *
 * The logic for removing a node from an AVL tree is similar.  We use standard
 * techniques to remove the node in question from the BST, then run a fixup
 * step like this one to fix all the imbalances in the tree.  This is tricky,
 * and the approach I've opted
 * to use is based on the discussion from the libavl discussion at
 * http://www.stanford.edu/~blp/avl/libavl.html/Deleting-from-a-BST.html.
 * However, I've opted to ignore their Case 2/Case 3 distinction, since I
 * don't see it as necessary.
 *
 * Case 1: If the node has no left child or no right child, we can just
 *         replace it with the child it does have (if any).
 *
 *                          a                a
 *                         / \              / \
 *                        Z   x     ->     Z   Y
 *                             \
 *                              Y
 *
 *         In this case, we need to begin a fixup pass from a, since the
 *         balance factors may have changed.
 *
 * Case 2: If the node has both children and its left child has a right child,
 *         then replace the node with its successor.  This works by
 *         identifying the node's successor in its left subtree, which is the
 *         leftmost node of the tree.  If it's not a leaf, then it's a node 
 *         missing a left child and we can easily delete it using the logic 
 *         in Case 1.  This raises the successor's subtree (if any) by one
 *         level in the tree.
 *
 * In both cases, there is some point in the tree in which some subtree's
 * height decreases by one, and we need to do apply the rebalance step to fix
 * it up.
