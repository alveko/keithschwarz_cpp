 * An algorithm for manipulating and generating permutations in lexicographic
 * order by using the factoradic number system.
 *
 * The factoradic number system (also called the factorial number system) is a
 * way of writing out numbers in a base system that depends on factorials,
 * rather than powers of numbers.  In the factoradic system, the last digit is
 * always 0 and is in base 0!.  The digit before that is either 0 or 1 and is
 * in base 1!.  The digit before that is either 0, 1, or 2 and is in base 2!.
 * More generally, the nth-to-last digit in always 0, 1, 2, ..., or n and is in
 * base n!.  When writing a number, we usually append a subscript ! to indicate
 * that it's written in factoradic base.  In this (plain-text) C++ source file,
 * I'll denote this by suffixing the number with _!.
 *
 * As an example, the factoradic number 2110_! is equal to
 *
 *      2 x 3! + 1 x 2! + 1 x 1! + 0 x 0!
 *    = 2 x 6  + 1 x 2  + 1 x 1  + 0 x 1
 *    =    12  +     2  +     1  +     0
 *    =    15
 *
 * Similarly, the first few factoradic numbers are
 *
 *     0_!  10_!  100_!  110_!  200_!  210_!  1000_!  1010_!  1100_!  1110_!
 *
 * One reason that the factoradic numbers are so useful is that there's a close
 * connection between factoradic numbers and permutations of distinct values.
 * To understand where this comes from, suppose that we're interested in
 * generating all of the permutations of some collection in lexicographic
 * order.  One way to do this might be to think about generating the first such
 * permutation, then the second, then the third, etc.  In other words, we want
 * to look for some way of mapping the integers onto permutations in a way that
 * allows us to efficiently answer the question "what is the nth permutation of
 * this set?"
 *
 * Let's consider permutations of four elements - a, b, c, and d - and the
 * order in which they're generated.  Here's a table of these permutations:
 *
 *               0  abcd       6 bacd      12 cabd      18 dabc
 *               1  abdc       7 badc      13 cadb      19 dacb
 *               2  acbd       8 bcad      14 cbad      20 dbac
 *               3  acdb       9 bcda      15 cbda      21 dbca
 *               4  adbc      10 bdac      16 cdab      22 dcab
 *               5  adcb      11 bdca      17 cdba      23 dcba
 *
 * Initially, there might not seem to be any pattern relating the numbers to
 * the permutations, but there are a few trends we can spot here.  For example,
 * every sixth permutation starts with a new letter, and 6 = 3!.  The second
 * letter of each permutation changes every two permutations, and 2 = 2!.
 *
 * If we rewrite the above table with the integers in factoradic base, then a
 * more obvious trend starts to appear:
 *
 *          0000_!  abcd  1000_! bacd  2000_! cabd  3000_! dabc
 *          0010_!  abdc  1010_! badc  2010_! cadb  3010_! dacb
 *          0100_!  acbd  1100_! bcad  2100_! cbad  3100_! dbac
 *          0110_!  acdb  1110_! bcda  2110_! cbda  3110_! dbca
 *          0200_!  adbc  1200_! bdac  2200_! cdab  3200_! dcab
 *          0210_!  adcb  1210_! bdca  2210_! cdba  3210_! dcba
 *
 * We noted above that the first letter changes every six permutations, and now
 * we can see that this coincides with the times at which the first digit of
 * the factoradic representation changes.  Similarly, when we noted that the
 * second letter of the permutation changed every two permutations, we can see
 * this is occurring whenever the second digit of the factoradic representation
 * of the index is changing.
 *
 * The connection here is due to a construction called "Lehmer codes," a way of
 * labeling permutations in a way that also allows their construction.  The
 * idea behind Lehmer codes is as follows.  Suppose that you are given a
 * permutation of a totally-ordered set of elements, such as the permutation
 * BEDAC of the letters A-E.  We start off by looking at the first letter of
 * this permutation - in this case, B - and seeing how many elements it's
 * bigger than (in this case, 1).  We then split this letter off of the
 * permutation and record the fact that it was bigger than one element:
 *
 *     B   EDAC
 *     1
 *
 * Now, we repeat this process on EDAC.  Here, E is larger than three of the
 * elements of EDAC (everything except itself), so we write out a three to get
 *
 *     BE  DAC
 *     13
 *
 * Repeating this on D gives us
 *
 *     BED  AC
 *     132
 *
 * And on A gives us
 *
 *     BEDA  C
 *     1320  0
 *
 * And finally on the last C gives us
 *
 *     BEDAC
 *     13200
 *
 * So the Lehmer code for this permutation is (1, 3, 2, 0, 0).  Note that the
 * length of a Lehmer code is equal to the number of elements in the
 * permutation.
 *
 * Given a permutation's Lehmer code, we can generate the permutation it stands
 * for by running this process backwards.  Suppose, for example, that we're
 * given the Lehmer code (3, 1, 0, 0) and want to use it to recover some given
 * permutation of ABCD.  To do this, we'd start off by taking the element of
 * this collection of letters that's bigger than three other elements.  This is
 * equivalent to asking which element is at position 3 using zero-indexing, and
 * gives us D.  So now we have
 *
 *     D    ABC
 *     3
 *
 * and the remaining Lehmer code (1, 0, 0).  Looking at the 1 in the first
 * position of this Lehmer code, we should take the element out of the unused
 * elements at position 1 (which, zero-indexed, is B), giving us
 *
 *     DB   AC
 *     31
 *
 * The rest of our code is (0, 0), so we take the zeroth-largest element of the
 * unused letters (A) and put it next:
 *
 *     DBA  C
 *     310
 *
 * And finally, we use the last part of our code, (0), to select the last
 * element of the permutation, which is C:
 *
 *     DBAC
 *     3100
 *
 * The clincher in all this is that there's a simple, one-to-one mapping
 * between the factoradic numbers and Lehmer codes.  The idea is simple - given
 * a Lehmer code (d0, d1, ..., dn), we just pick the number
 *
 *                                d0 d1 d2 ... dn_!
 *
 * For example, given Lehmer code (3, 1, 0, 0), we'd pick the factoradic number
 * 3100_!.  Similarly, given factoradic number 210_!, we'd pick the Lehmer code
 * (2, 1, 0).
 *
 * In order to convince ourselves that this is even mathematically well-defined
 * we need to see that each of the digits we assign are within the range
 * specified for that digit.  For example, if it were possible that we could
 * have a Lehmer code (1, 4), then we couldn't convert it to the factoradic
 * number 14_!, since the last digit of any factoradic number must be 0.  This
 * is not particularly difficult to see.  Remember that the digits of the
 * Lehmer code are zero-based indices into the list of elements we haven't yet
 * used yet.  Thus the last digit must be zero, since there's only one element
 * remaining; the penultimate digit can be either one or zero since there's
 * two possible choices; the antepenultimate digit can be zero, one or two;
 * etc.
 *
 * Given the bijiective correspondence between Lehmer codes and the factoradic
 * numbers, we have a way of taking a natural number N and mapping it into a
 * permutation of some number of elements.  However, as of now we have no
 * reason to believe that this will list every permutation in lexicographic
 * order.  After all, given some random encoding system for permutations, why
 * should we expect anything special out of our ordering?  Fortunately, though
 * we have the following lemma:
 *
 * Lemma: Given two permutations p_1 and p_2 with Lehmer codes L_1 and L_2,
 * p_1 lexicographically precedes p_2 iff L_1 lexicographically precedes L_2.
 *
 * Corollary: Every permutation has a unique Lehmer code.
 *
 * Before we go into the proof, I should remark that this guarantees that the
 * following algorithm will list all permutations of n elements in order:
 *
 * For i = 0 to n! - 1:
 *    Represent i in factoradic base.
 *    Convert this representation to a Lehmer code.
 *    Generate the permutation based on this Lehmer code.
 *
 * This algorithm works correctly because every permutation has a Lehmer code,
 * and by iterating over all n! different codes we'll hit every permutation.
 * Moreover, our lemma guarantees that no two permutations have the same
 * Lehmer code, we know that we'll get every permutation in order and exactly
 * once.
 *
 * Proof of lemma: We first prove that if p_1 < p_2, then L_1 < L_2.  Given the
 * two permutations, consider the first elements at which the permutations
 * disagree, call this index i.  Note that i can't be the last element of the
 * permutations, because that would mean that the permutations agree in every
 * position except the last, and since the last element doesn't match it means
 * that the permutations aren't of the same elements.  Since the permutations
 * agree on the first i - 1 elements, the Lehmer codes for the first i - 1
 * elements must agree.  This means that at the time the ith digit of the
 * Lehmer code is being chosen, in both permutations the same set of leftover
 * elements will remain.  Since p_1 < p_2, the ith element of p_1 must be
 * smaller than the ith element of p_2, and so the index of that element in
 * what's left must be smaller than the index of the corresponding element from
 * p_2 in what's left.  Consequently, the digit chosen for L_1 will be less
 * than the digit for L_2, and since the codes agree on their prefix before
 * this we have that L_1 < L_2.
 *
 * To prove the opposite direction, suppose that L_1 < L_2 and find the first
 * spot at which they disagree; say it's index i.  i cannot be the last spot
 * in the code, since the very last digit must be a 0, so it has to be some
 * place before that.  Since the prefixes of the codes match up to that point,
 * at the spot where L_1 chooses a lower number than L_2, the partial
 * permutations built up so far must match and the remaining elements must be
 * the same.  Consequently, when L_1 has a lower value than L_2, the resulting
 * permutation will have a smaller value in p_1 than in p_2, and since the
 * prefixes match the result will be that p_1 < p_2.  QED.
 *
 * The functions exported by this file allow for the generation and
 * manipulation of permutations using factoradic number representations.  They
 * run in quadratic time, though faster implementations are possible using more
 * complex algorithms.
