 * An implementation of the "binary quicksort" algorithm, another name for MSD-
 * radix sort in base 2.  The algorithm is a non-comparison sort for sorting
 * integers that works by sorting the numbers one bit at a time, starting with
 * the most significant digit and ending with the least-significant digit.
 * Internally, the algorithm works by first sorting the numbers into ascending
 * order by the first bit, then recursively sorting each half of the numbers by
 * their second digit, etc.  For example, given the numbers 0-7 in scrambled
 * order, like this:
 *
 *         3   1   4   0   5   7   2   6
 *
 * We would write these numbers in binary to get
 *
 *       011 001 100 000 101 111 010 110
 *
 * First, we sort the numbers by just their first digit.  For example:
 *
 *       011 001 000 010 100 101 111 110
 *       ^               ^
 *       |               |
 *       |               +--- Numbers beginning with a 1
 *       |
 *       +------------------- Numbers beginning with a 0
 *
 *
 * Notice that we now have the array split into two regions - one region
 * consisting of values beginning with a 0 and one region consisting of values
 * beginning with a 1.  We now recursively descend into these two regions and
 * sort each one by their second digit.  This gives the following:
 *
 *       001 000 011 010 100 101 111 110
 *
 * From here we sort by the third digit:
 *
 *       000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
 *
 * And the numbers are now in order.
 *
 * In order to convert this sketch of an algorithm into a concrete
 * implementation, we will need to devise a means for sorting a range of
 * numbers by just a single digit.  One option for doing this out-of-place is
 * to build two queues, one for numbers with a 0 in that bit and one for
 * numbers with a 1 in at that bit, then add each number in the range to the
 * appropriate queue.  We can then dequeue the numbers from the 0 queue and the
 * 1 queue, in order, and insert them back into the original array.  For
 * example, given these numbers, which we want to sort by the most significant
 * bit:
 *
 *       011 001 100 000 101 111 010 110
 *
 * We would build two queues and insert the numbers as follows:
 *
 *   Begins with 0: 011 001 000 010
 *   Begins with 1: 100 101 111 110
 *
 * We would then concatenate these two queues and store the result back into
 * the original array:
 *
 *      011 001 000 010 100 101 111 110
 *
 * While this works, it has the drawback that it requires O(n) auxiliary
 * storage.  Fortunately, there is a faster algorithm for solving this problem
 * that works in-place.  The intuition behind the algorithm is that we want to
 * reorder the elements so that the array ends up being split into two regions-
 * a region on the left consisting of all values that contain a 0 at the
 * appropriate bit, and a region on the right consisting of all values that
 * contain a 1 at the appropriate bit.  We can therefore build an algorithm
 * that scans inward from the two sides of the array looking for numbers that
 * violate this invariant, then exchange the numbers that are out of place.
 * For example, suppose we have this sequence of 0s and 1s:
 *
 *        0  1  0  1  0  1  1  0  1
 *
 * We would march two pointers in from the left and right side looking for a
 * point where elements are found that are out of place.  This would first find
 * this pair:
 *
 *        0  1  0  1  0  1  1  0  1
 *           ^                 ^
 *
 * We exchange those numbers, as shown here:
 *
 *        0  0  0  1  0  1  1  1  1
 *           ^                 ^
 *
 * and then march inward to find this next pair:
 *
 *        0  0  0  1  0  1  1  1  1
 *                 ^  ^
 *
 * which we swap to obtain
 *
 *        0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1
 *                 ^  ^
 *
 * and at this point are done.  This algorithm is very similar to the partition
 * step found in most quicksort implementations, and for this reason the MSD-
 * radix sort is often called binary quicksort.
 *
 * To analyze the runtime of the algorithm, note that running the partitioning
 * step on k integers takes O(k) time, since each element is visited at most
 * O(1) times.  Initially, this means that we do O(n) work to partition the
 * values by their first bit, then a total of O(n) work to partition each half
 * by the second bit, etc.  More generally, if the largest possible value that
 * can appear is U, there will be O(log U) partioning steps required, one for
 * each of the bits in U.  This means that the total runtime is O(n log U).
 * In cases where U = O(n), this is asympototically better than or comparable
 * to comparison sorts like quicksort or heap sort.
